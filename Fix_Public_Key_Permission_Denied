1. GitHUb - How to fix this issue? 
Step 1 - Create SSH key pair
One of the easiest ways for you to generate a key pair is by running ssh-keygen utility.

Open the command prompt and type in the following


$ ssh-keygen

BASH
(Note - If you do not have ssh-keygen installed on the window then Click here.)

To keep the ssh-keygen simple, do not enter any key name or passphrase.

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/rahulwagh/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/rahulwagh/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/rahulwagh/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:Okq3w+SesCGLQVToSBQru8RdUZtT2EIIrzH5MQ67DWA rahulwagh@local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|.ooo..+oo.       |
| oo o..o+.       |
|=E = = +.        |
|*oo X o .        |
|.+ = o  S        |
|o.  + ..         |
|o ..+=+          |
| o + *++         |
|. . o.+.         |
+----[SHA256]-----+
BASH

Where to find the key pair
The file will be generated at - /Users/rahulwagh/.ssh/

Name of the file - id_rsa.pub
